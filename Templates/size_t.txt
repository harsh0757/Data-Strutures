size_t is an unsigned integer type used to represent the size of objects in bytes or array indices. 
It is defined in <stddef.h> (C) and <cstddef> (C++).

✅ Use size_t:
- sizeof
- array/vector/string indexing
- count of elements
- loop index over containers

❌ Don’t use size_t:
- When result can be negative
- When using general-purpose integers
- For signed math or user inputs
