Templates allow you to write generic and reusable code. 
Instead of writing the same function/class multiple times for different data types, you write it once using a template.

what are Templates?
Templates are the blueprint for functions or classes that work with any datatype

There are two main types:

1. Function Templates

2. Class Templates

why to use them?
--> To eliminate text duplication
--> Enable type dependent programming
--> foundation of STL (vector, map)
