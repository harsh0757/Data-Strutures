Range-based loop : A range-based loop is a type of loop that automatically iterates over a sequence (such as an array, list, or range of numbers)
without the need for manually specifying the index or counter. It simplifies the code for traversing through each element in the sequence.

Auto keyword : The auto keyword in C++ is used to automatically deduce the type of a variable from its initializer (the value it's being assigned). 
It simplifies code and reduces redundancy, especially when the type is long or complex.


for pairs or any data type we can use auto
