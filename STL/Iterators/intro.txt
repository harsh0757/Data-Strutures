Iterators points to the element of containers in STL.

Iterator pointing to first index is .begin() --> v[0]
.end() will point to next to the last element  --> next to last

(it + 1) and (it++) difference
it++ --> it will move to next Iterator
it + 1 --> move to next location means it moves to 0 to 1 index

in vector case both are same becuase of contigous memory

***in maps and sets the scenario is different (it + 1 ) will be invalid location  discontinous location***
